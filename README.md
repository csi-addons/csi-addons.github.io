# Container Storage Interface Addons

The CSI-Addons project hosts extensions to the [CSI specification][csi_spec]
that provide advanced storage operations.

By adding new procedures to the [CSI-Addons Specification][spec], additional
operations for storage systems can be provided. The reference implementation is
done on Kubernetes, and maintained in the [Kubernetes CSI-Addons
repository][kubernetes-csi-addons].
